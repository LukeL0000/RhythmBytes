#RhythmBytes

This project is a simple rhythm game based on using the arrow keys to hit each beat. Players will have a 
single life, meaning one miss will result in the game ending. The score system is calculated based on data
size measurements, meaning it will use units such as KB, MB, GB, etc. 

To note, this is an earlier project made in python, so implementation-wise it will be much less principled than
newer projects such as BookManager, which follows a more modular design. 

Overall, this is a currently functional project made in Python, which could be refined by a adding a more 
intelligent beat generating technique, better user interface, and refactoring into a more principled structure.
